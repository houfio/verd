Thank you for participating in this experiment on sustainable consumer behaviour!

<br/>

**What did I just do?**

You were put into one of two groups: the control group or the experimental group. If you saw sustainability labels on the product pages, you were in the experimental group. If you didn't see them, you were in the control group. This study compares how people behave with and without the labels.

<br/>

**Can I participate again?**

Unfortunately, you cannot participate again.

<br/>

**Can I share this experiment with others?**

Yes, and it would be greatly appreciated! Just share the URL of this page, and they'll be able to participate.

<br/>

**What should I do if I have questions?**

If you have any questions or concerns about this study, feel free to contact my supervisor, Dr Andrea Szymkowiak, at a.szymkowiak@abertay.ac.uk.
