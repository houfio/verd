Thank you for participating in this experiment on sustainable consumer behaviour!

<br/>

**What did I just do?**

This research project was designed to understand strategies of promoting sustainable products online. The study aims to identify potential methods that can close the gap between consumers' expressed intentions to buy sustainable products and their actual purchasing behaviour. Participants are split up into two groups; the control group and the experimental group. If you saw sustainability labels on the product pages, you were part of the experimental group. If you didn't, you were part of the control group.
