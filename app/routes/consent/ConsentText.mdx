# Before we start...

<br/>

**What is the research about?**

We invite you to participate in a research project about buying behaviour of customers in webshops.

<br/>

**Do I have to take part?**

This form has been written to help you decide if you would like to take part. It is up to you and you alone whether you wish to take part. If you do decide to take part, you will be free to withdraw at any time without providing a reason and without penalty.

<br/>

**What will I be required to do?**

You will be given three scenarios for products to buy. In a fake webshop, you will be asked to buy the three products product fitting the criteria of the scenarios. These purchases should be made as you would do in real life scenarios, taking product specifications, price and more into account. After all products have been added to the basket, the experiment ends.

<br/>

**How will you handle my data?**

Your data will be stored in an anonymised form and will only be accessible to the researcher (2200513@uad.ac.uk). This means that nobody including the researchers could reasonably identify you within the data. Your data will be stored in London, with data fully anonymised at the point of collection. Your responses are treated in the strictest confidence - it will be impossible to identify individuals within a dataset when any of the research is disseminated (e.g., in publications/presentations). Abertay University acts as Data Controller (DataProtectionOfficer@abertay.ac.uk).

<br/>

**Retention of research data**

Researchers are obliged to retain research data for up to 10 years post-publication, however your anonymised research data may be retained indefinitely (e.g., so that researchers engage in open practice and other researchers can access their data to confirm the conclusions of published work). Consistent with our data retention policy, researchers retain consent forms for as long as we continue to hold information about a data subject and for 10 years for published research (including Research Degree thesis).

<br/>

**Consent statement**

Abertay University attaches high priority to the ethical conduct of research. Please consider the following before indicating your consent on this form. Indicating your consent confirms that you are willing to participate in the research, however, indicating consent does not commit you to anything you do not wish to do and you are free to withdraw your participation at any time. You are indicating consent under the following assumptions:

<br/>

- I understand the contents of the participant information sheet and consent form.
- I have been given the opportunity to ask questions about the research and have had them answered satisfactorily.
- I understand that my participation is entirely voluntary and that I can withdraw from the research (parts of the project or the entire project) at any time without penalty and without having to provide an explanation.
- I understand who has access to my data and how it will be handled at all stages of the research project.
